# Goalaroo Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Overview

Goalaroo is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking children's behavioral goals. This document outlines the security measures, potential risks, and best practices implemented in the application.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Magic Link Authentication**: Passwordless authentication via email codes
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based session management
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **CORS Protection**: Restricted cross-origin requests

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS 1.2+ on all endpoints
- **Private Subnets**: ECS tasks run in private subnets
- **Security Groups**: Minimal required network access
- **IAM Least Privilege**: Minimal required AWS permissions

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: DynamoDB tables encrypted
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS for all communications
- **Secure Parameter Storage**: Secrets in AWS SSM Parameter Store
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization

## 🔍 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication Security
- ✅ JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- ✅ Cryptographically secure magic code generation
- ✅ Email validation using validator library
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired codes
- ✅ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### 2. Network Security
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement with modern TLS
- ✅ CORS configuration with specific origins
- ✅ Security headers via Helmet.js
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Private subnets for ECS tasks
- ✅ NAT gateways for outbound internet access
- ✅ Security groups with minimal required access
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege principle
- ✅ S3 bucket with public access blocked

### 4. Data Security
- ✅ DynamoDB encryption at rest
- ✅ SSM Parameter Store for secrets
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error handling without information disclosure

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### 1. Session Storage
- **Current**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- **Risk**: Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- **Mitigation**: Consider httpOnly cookies for production

### 2. Magic Code Security
- **Current**: 6-digit numeric codes
- **Risk**: Brute force attacks (mitigated by rate limiting)
- **Mitigation**: Consider longer codes or additional factors

### 3. Error Handling
- **Current**: Generic error messages
- **Risk**: Potential information disclosure
- **Mitigation**: Implement structured error logging

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@mcsoko.com
- GitHub: Create a private security advisory

### Response Timeline
- **Critical**: 24 hours
- **High**: 72 hours
- **Medium**: 1 week
- **Low**: 2 weeks

## 🔧 Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Dependency Updates**: Monthly security updates
2. **SSL Certificate Renewal**: Automated via ACM
3. **Security Group Reviews**: Quarterly audits
4. **IAM Permission Reviews**: Quarterly audits
5. **Log Analysis**: Continuous monitoring

### Security Monitoring
- CloudWatch logs for suspicious activity
- AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing (annual)
